      <p class="lede">Welcome to UDLex — a community and resource hub for Roblox developers. This guide walks you through joining our community, configuring your profile, sharing projects, finding collaborators, and making the most of UDLex's features.</p>

      <h2 id="why-udlex">Why join UDLex?</h2>
      <p>UDLex brings together developers, educators, and creators who build on Roblox. Joining helps you:</p>

        <li>Access tutorials, tooling, and curated resources.</li>
        <li>Participate in community events like jams and workshops.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="join-discord">1. Join the Discord</h2>
      <p>The quickest way to get started is to join our Discord at <a href="https://discord.gg/unifydevs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discord.gg/unifydevs</a>. When you join we suggest you:</p>

        <li>Familiarize yourself with the community guidelines and any verification steps for new members.</li>
        <li>Explore the project showcase, collaboration spaces, and support channels to find relevant conversations and opportunities.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="set-up-profile">2. Set up your profile and portfolio</h2>
      <p>Make your first impression count:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Prepare a short project blurb and include screenshots or a short demo.</li>
        <li>Include links to repositories or forum posts so others can review your work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="share-projects">3. Share your project</h2>

        <li>Installation or play instructions and required Roblox versions.</li>
        <li>Screenshots or a short demo video/GIF.</li>
        <li>Links to repositories, models, or deployment previews.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="find-collaborators">4. Find collaborators</h2>
