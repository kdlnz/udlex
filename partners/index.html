        <!-- Ineligible Partnerships -->
        <h2>Ineligible Partnerships</h2>
        <p>
          Any server or organization that meets one or more of the following conditions
          will not qualify for a UDLex partnership:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Ad-Only Communities</strong><br />
            Servers focused exclusively on advertisement, giveaway farming, or bot-pings
            without substantive development or collaboration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inactive or Low-Quality Engagement</strong><br />
            Communities with minimal active participation, no evidence of regular events,

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-Reciprocal Arrangements</strong><br />
            Partners that do not follow through on promotion or fail to maintain open lines
            of communication (e.g., unresponsive leadership, inability to join co-hosting activities).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content Violations</strong><br />
            Servers that broadcast NSFW content, hate speech, exploit-related tools, or
